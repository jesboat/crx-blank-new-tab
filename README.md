This one time, I caught Chrome's default "New Tab" pages collectively taking up a bit over 500 MB of RAM. Enough was enough, so I bashed this out over an hour or two. It is the bare minimum necessary to meet my needs, and nothing else.

This is a source dump, public in case somebody finds it useful. It is not supported in any way.
